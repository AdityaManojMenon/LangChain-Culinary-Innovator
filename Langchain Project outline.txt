The "Restaurant Name Generator" is a Streamlit-based application that leverages OpenAI's language model to generate a fancy restaurant name and menu items based on the selected cuisine. 
The project involves creating a user interface in Streamlit, defining helper functions to interact with the OpenAI API, and chaining prompts to generate the desired outputs.

Steps to Create the Project:
1. Install required libraries: Streamlit, OpenAI, and LangChain.
2. Ensure the secret_key.py file contains the OpenAI API key for secure access.
3. Create a simple Streamlit interface with a dropdown to select the cuisine.
4. Display the generated restaurant name and menu items.
5. I created a seperate file for the helper function which is responsible for making calls to OpenAI API to use the gpt LLM for the project based 
what the user decides the cuisine type to be. The same can be achieved with creating helper function in the same file.
6. Define functions to generate the restaurant name and menu items using LangChain.

Conclusoin:
The project involves setting up a Streamlit interface for user input, defining helper functions to interact with OpenAI's API, and chaining prompts to generate a restaurant name and menu items based on the selected cuisine. 
The application provides a user-friendly interface to generate creative restaurant names and menu items efficiently.
